        <h2 id="Wb">WebDevelopment</h2>
        <p>
          Web development is the process of building websites and web
          applications that people interact with using a browser (like Chrome,
          Firefox, Safari). It covers everything from a simple personal blog to
          complex platforms like YouTube or Amazon. It’s usually divided into
          front-end (the part users see and use) and back-end (the part that
          works behind the scenes).
        </p>
        <p>
          Front-End Development (Client-Side) This is what runs in your browser.
          Its goal is to create a smooth, attractive, and interactive user
          experience. Languages: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) → the
          structure of a page (headings, text, images, links). CSS (Cascading
          Style Sheets) → the style and layout (colors, fonts, responsiveness).
          JavaScript → interactivity (buttons, animations, data validation,
          dynamic updates). Frameworks/Libraries: React, Vue, Angular,
          Bootstrap. These speed up development and provide reusable components.
          Tools: Browsers, developer tools, version control (Git).

        <h2 id="Cyb">CyberThreats</h2>
        <p>
          A cyberthreat is any potential malicious attempt to damage, disrupt,
          or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data.
          Threats can come from hackers, malware, insiders, or even
          state-sponsored groups. The goal might be stealing data, causing
          chaos, or making money (like with ransomware).
        </p>
        <p>
          Common types include malware like viruses, worms, ransomware, and
          spyware, phishing scams that trick people into giving away
          credentials, denial-of-service attacks that overwhelm servers, SQL
          injections that manipulate databases, and zero-day exploits that
          target newly discovered flaws. Insider threats are also serious, as
          employees with access can misuse or accidentally expose systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defending against cyberthreats involves technical measures such as
          firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption, and strong
          authentication, combined with best practices like regular patching,
          security training, and limiting user privileges. Monitoring with tools
          such as SIEM helps detect suspicious activity. Real-world examples
          like the WannaCry ransomware attack or the Equifax breach show how
          dangerous unpatched systems and social engineering can be.

        <h2 id="Op">Operating Systems</h2>
        <p>
          An operating system (OS) is the core software that sits between a
          computer’s hardware and the applications we run. Without it, programs
          wouldn’t know how to talk to the CPU, memory, storage, or input
          devices. The OS manages everything so that multiple programs can share
          the same machine safely and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The OS is made of several key parts. The kernel is the heart of the
          system, handling low-level tasks like process scheduling (deciding
          which program gets CPU time), memory management, and communication
          with hardware through drivers. The file system organizes data into
          files and directories on storage devices, while system libraries and
          APIs give applications a way to request services without touching
          hardware directly. The OS also provides user interfaces, like the
          command line or a graphical desktop environment, so people can
          interact with the machine.
